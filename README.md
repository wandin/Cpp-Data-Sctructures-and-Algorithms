2. For any given Tree(*T*) with Height *h* there are at least (*h+1*) nodes, and atmost $2^{(h+1)}$ -1 nodes
3. For any given Tree(*T*) with *n* nodes the minimum heigh is -> $\log_2^{(n+1)}$ - 1 and maximum height(*h*) of -> (*n-1*)

4.**Only for Complete Binary Trees**

4.1. Let (*i*) be the position for any node(Element) in an Array then
	a node's Left-child exists at 2x*i* position and if 2x*i* > n, then no Left-child exists for that Node
4.2. A node's Right-Child exists at 2x*i*+1 position and if 2x*i*+1 > *n* then no Right-Child exists for that node.
4.3. A node's parent exists at (*i*/2) position and if *i* then no parent exists (it's the Root node)

5. At each Height the max number of Nodes(*n*) is equals to -> $2^{\text{(h))}}-1$ -->

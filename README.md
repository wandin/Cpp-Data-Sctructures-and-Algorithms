# LinkedLists

This repository contains the implementation of a linked list (LinkedList) in C++ as an Abstract Data Type (ADT). Below are the operations performed on the LinkedList:

## Operations on LinkedList

1. **Insert:** Inserts an element at a specific position in the linked list.
2. **Delete:** Deletes an element from a specific position in the linked list.
3. **Find:** Finds an element at a specific position in the linked list.
4. **Search:** Searches for an element in the linked list and returns its position.
5. **Display:** Displays all elements of the linked list.
6. **IsEmpty:** Checks if the linked list is empty.
7. **Concat:** Concatenates two linked lists.

###This README.md provides an overview of the available operations on LinkedList and how to use them. You can use this format as a template to document other data structures that will be implemented in the future.

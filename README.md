## Usage
To use this program:
1. Compile the `RadixSort.cpp` file.
2. Run the executable.
3. The program will display the array before and after sorting using Radix Sort.

## Notes
- The Radix Sort implemented in this program focuses on sorting based on decimal digits (base 10). For other bases such as binary, octal, or hexadecimal, modify the `CountingSort` function by adjusting the modulus operation accordingly.



# Hashing (Hashing.cpp Within Sorting Folder)

## Description
This program implements a Hashing technique with linear probing in C++ (located in the Sorting folder). It provides methods to insert, delete, search, and display elements in a hash table using linear probing to handle collisions.

## Operations on Hashing

### HashFunction
- **Description:** Computes the hash index for a given key using the modulus operator.
- **Parameters:**
    - `k`: Key for which the hash index is to be computed.
- **Returns:** The hash index for the key `k`.

### Insert Function
- **Description:** Inserts an element into the hash table.
- **Parameters:**
    - `e`: Element to be inserted into the hash table.
- **Returns:** The current hash table object after insertion.

### Delete Function
- **Description:** Deletes an element from the hash table.
- **Parameters:**
    - `e`: Element to be deleted from the hash table.

### Search Function
- **Description:** Searches for an element in the hash table.
- **Parameters:**
    - `k`: Key to be searched in the hash table.
    - `e`: Element found at the hash index.
- **Returns:** 1 if the element is found, 0 otherwise.

### Display Function
- **Description:** Displays the elements of the hash table.
- **Parameters:**
    - None

## Main Function
The main function is the entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:
- Initializes the hash table with a given size.
- Inserts predefined elements into the hash table.
- Displays the hash table after each operation (insertion, deletion).
- Attempts to delete a non-existent element to demonstrate the handling of such cases.
- Inserts additional elements to show the process of handling collisions and the use of linear probing.
- Displays the hash table after all operations.

## Usage
To use this program:
1. Compile the `Hashing.cpp` file.
2. Run the executable.
3. The program will display the hash table after various operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.

## Notes
- This implementation uses linear probing to handle collisions. When the computed hash index is already occupied, the program linearly probes the next indices to find an empty slot.
- The hash table size is set to 11 by default, but it can be adjusted as needed. The hash function uses the modulus operator to compute the hash index.

# Hashing with Chaining (HashingChaining.cpp Within Sorting Folder)

## Description
This program implements the Hashing with Chaining technique in C++ (located in the Sorting folder). It provides a method to manage a hash table where collisions are handled using linked lists (chaining).

## Operations on Hashing with Chaining

### Node Structure
- **Description:** Represents a key-value pair in the hash table.
- **Members:**
    - `key`: The key of the node.
    - `value`: The value associated with the key.
    - `next`: Pointer to the next node in the linked list.

### HashTable Class
- **Description:** Implements a hash table using the chaining technique for collision handling.
- **Members:**
    - `table`: A vector of pointers to `Node`, representing the hash table.
    - `size`: The size of the hash table.
    - `Hash(int key)`: A private method that calculates the hash index for a given key.

### HashTable Constructor
- **Description:** Initializes the hash table with a given size.
- **Parameters:**
    - `sz`: The size of the hash table.

### HashTable Destructor
- **Description:** Cleans up the dynamically allocated memory for the hash table.

### Insert Function
- **Description:** Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.
- **Parameters:**
    - `key`: The key to be inserted.
    - `value`: The value associated with the key.

### Search Function
- **Description:** Searches for a key in the hash table and returns its value.
- **Parameters:**
    - `key`: The key to be searched.
- **Returns:** The value associated with the key if found, otherwise returns `-1`.

### Remove Function
- **Description:** Removes a key from the hash table.
- **Parameters:**
    - `key`: The key to be removed.

### Main Function
The main function is the entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:
- Creates a hash table with a predefined size.
- Inserts some key-value pairs into the hash table.
- Searches for a key and displays its value if found.
- Removes a key from the hash table.
- Searches for the key again after removal to verify it has been deleted.
- Displays appropriate messages based on the search results.

## Usage
To use this program:
1. Compile the `HashingChaining.cpp` file.
2. Run the executable.
3. The program will insert, search, and remove keys in the hash table, displaying the results of these operations.

## Notes
- This implementation uses chaining to handle collisions in the hash table. Each index in the hash table's array points to the head of a linked list containing all key-value pairs that hash to that index.
- Ensure to delete the dynamically allocated memory in the destructor to avoid memory leaks.
